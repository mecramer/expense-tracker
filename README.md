# Expense tracker

 This app tracks expenses for a single person. Credits and debits are entered along with a description

* User enters two fields, the text description and the amount
* Each entry gets added to a running list of transactions
* The total list produces a total of income and expenses as well as a balance (income - expenses)
* A red x next seen on hovering over an expense allows it to be removed
* The transactions are saved in local storage, saving them when the browser closes
* Technologies used: CSS Grid, flex-box, CSS variables, event listeners, forEach(), map(), filter(), reduce(), local storage
